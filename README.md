## Purpose

The Fitness Blog is a web application that allows users to share fitness posts, blogs, or log their daily workouts. It was built using React, React Bootstrap, and Firebase, and makes use of the Firebase sign in with Google functionality.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind the development of the Fitness Blog was to build a platform where friends and I could share our workout logs and training programs, and keep each other accountable for our workouts. It was also an opportunity to try out new authentication strategies using Firebase's sign in with Google functionality.

## Tech Stack

The Fitness Blog was built using the following technologies:

-   React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
-   React Bootstrap: A front-end framework for building responsive, mobile-first projects using Bootstrap
-   Firebase: A cloud-based platform for building and scaling applications

## Features

The Fitness Blog includes the following features:

-   Google sign in: Users can sign in to the Fitness Blog using their Google account.
-   Post creation and deletion: Users can create posts and delete the posts that they have created themselves.
-   Post feed: Users can view posts that others have posted in their feed.

## Challenges

One challenge that I encountered while building the Fitness Blog was implementing the conditional rendering of components based on the user's authentication state. This involved setting up the necessary logic to determine when to show or hide certain components based on the user's login status.

## Accomplishments

Through building the Fitness Blog, I was able to achieve the following accomplishments:

-   Learn how to use React, React Bootstrap, and Firebase to build a functional web application
-   Implement a sign in with Google feature using Firebase
-   Create a platform for users to share fitness posts and logs, and keep each other accountable for their workouts
-   Practice coding skills and improve proficiency in React and Firebase.

## Future Changes

There are a number of things that could be done to improve the Fitness Blog in the future. Some potential improvements could include:

-   Adding more features to the post creation form, such as the ability to add images or videos
-   Implementing a comment system so users can interact with and discuss each other's posts
-   Adding a search feature to allow users to find specific posts or users
-   Integrating with additional APIs or services to provide more comprehensive fitness information and features.
